# Dependency-Injection-Guide

I like the [DependencyInjection](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/main/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection) library of Microsoft and use it as a basis of my another projects broadly. I've prepared a handbook-project which demonstrates common features of the library in a simple way which helps me make a quick start when I need it. I would be glad if it gets helpful for someone else too.
